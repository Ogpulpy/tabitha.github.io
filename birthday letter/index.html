            <h1>Happy Birthday Tabitha (My Precious Pearl)!</h1>
            <p>
                Happy Birthday!

                Today is all about you. Your light, your soul, your everything. There’s something about you that words
                can’t quite reach, but I’ll try anyway. The way you move through life with grace, the way you see the
                world, the way your presence changes the atmosphere — it’s magic. You’re magic.

                You don’t even realize how deeply you’re loved, how much your heart means to the people lucky enough to
                know it. You’ve brought warmth into my cold spaces, hope into my quiet nights, and love into places where
                there used to be none. Every conversation with you lingers, every laugh stays in my head like a favorite
                song.

                I hope this birthday wraps you in softness; the kind you give to others so freely. I hope you feel
                seen, celebrated, and held. You deserve the best kind of love, and I hope you never settle for anything
                less.

                Life is messy, wild, and beautiful — and I’m glad you’re here to live it, to shape it, to feel it all.
                Keep dreaming, keep glowing, and keep being exactly who you are. There’s no one like you, Tabitha. I Love you!!!!!

                All the love,
                John.
            </p>
